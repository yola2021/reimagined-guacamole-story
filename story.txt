There was once a young avocado named Terrence. Terrence had a mother named Cindy and a sister named Charlie. They all lived in a big and beautiful 
avocado orchard, hanging from an aged avocado tree. Terrence had a very small seed in his belly and when he grew up he wanted to be just like his mom 
with a big seed that he could be proud of. Cindy told Terrence that he would have a big seed one day, if only he kept up with his school work and dreamt 
sweet dreams of far off lands and spectacular creatures. So each day Terrence woke up and went to school and hit the books and each night Terrence went 
to sleep and dreamt of far off lands and fantastical creatures. One day, he thought, his seed would be big and beautiful. 

One day Terrence dreamt of a far off land with a spectacular creature tha thad purple
stripes and could grant wishes. Terrance wished for the creature to give him a big seed
in his belly that he could be proud of, just like his mother. The creature with purple 
stripes told him that they couldn't grant that wish, it could only happen through 
keeping up with school work and dreaming sweet dreams. The creature then pulled Terrance's 
seed from his body using its stripes. He fell to the ground and was reborn as an avocado
tree. There Terrence stayed for generations, just like the aged avocado tree he came
from. Many avocados grew on him, all of them with big seeds in their bellies that he
was proud of.
When he awoke Terrence was confused. What did it mean? Whatever it was he figured
it would be best to keep up with his school work and dream sweet dreams of far off
lands and spectacular creatures.

As such, Terrance resigned himself to forgoe his dreams and just live his life in peace as an entirely average avocado. It turns out, that is all he ever really wanted in the first place.  Terrence lived happily every after...
