There was once a young avocado named Terrence. Terrence had a mother named Cindy and a sister named Charlie. They all lived in a big and beautiful 
avocado orchard, hanging from an aged avocado tree. Terrence had a very small seed in his belly and when he grew up he wanted to be just like his mom 
with a big seed that he could be proud of. Cindy told Terrence that he would have a big seed one day, if only he kept up with his school work and dreamt 
sweet dreams of far off lands and spectacular creatures. So each day Terrence woke up and went to school and hit the books and each night Terrence went 
to sleep and dreamt of far off lands and fantastical creatures. One day, he thought, his seed would be big and beautiful.
